# hike planner app

Code that supports an AWS-based hike planning assistant serverless web application

Application is accessible at [benpatton.net](https://benpatton.net), but still has limited functionality. I hope to expand it and improve its features soon!

Built as a final project for University of New Hampshire IT 780: Introduction to Cloud Computing.
